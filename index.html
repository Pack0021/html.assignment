   <h1> All About Thom</h1>
<p> My name is Thom Packman. I’m from a small town three hours out of Ottawa named Peterborough. I’m 24 and I’m currently at Algonquin College taking interactive media design and I’m hoping to land a wicked career doing something creative and with my hands. I have a small YouTube channel on the side to show my creativity online!</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies Include...</h3>
    <div>&square; <b>Reading!</b> I love reading! It’s a new recent hobby I picked up! I wanted to get better and my English language because I struggle with grammar and such.<br>&square; My other hobby includes <b>video games</b>. I enjoy it because I get to keep in touch with my bro since I’m 3 hours away.<br>&square; Lastly, I like to <b>exercise</b>. The gym is a final hobby. Fitness is key to a healthy lifestyle!</div>
