    <h1> All About Thom</h1>
<p> My name is Thom Packman. I’m from a small town three hours out of Ottawa named Peterborough. I’m 24 and I’m currently at Algonquin College taking interactive media design and I’m hoping to land a wicked career doing something creative and with my hands. I have a small YouTube channel on the side to show my creativity online!</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies Include...</h3>
    <p>Reading! I love reading! It’s a new recent hobby I picked up! I wanted to get better and my English language because I struggle with grammar and such. My other hobby includes video games. I enjoy it because I get to keep in touch with my bro since I’m 3 hours away. Lastly, I like to exercise. When I’m not reading or doing whatever I’m at the gym three times a week. Fitness is key to a healthy lifestyle! </p>
