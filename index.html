    <h1> All About Thom</h1>

<article> "Now Heres Alittle About Myself" </article>
<p> My name is Thom Packman. I’m from a small town 3 hours out of Ottawa named Peterborough. I’m 24 and I’m currently at Algonquin College taking interactive media design and I’m hoping to land a wicked career doing something creative and with my hands. I have a small YouTube channel on the side to show my creativity online!</p>
